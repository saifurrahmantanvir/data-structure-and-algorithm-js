# Data Structures and Algorithm

This repo is my notes of data struture and algorithm with javascript.

**1. Big O notation**

How to find out efficiency of an algorithm with Big-O Notation. How to find time and space complexity of an algorithm.


**2. Built-in Data structures (e.g Objects and Arrays)**

A deep dive into the built-in data structures and their methods like array.push pop slice map filter reduce and Object.keys entries values.


**3. Problem Solving Approach**

How to break down a problem step by step.


**4. Problem Solving Patterns**

Some common patterns of solving problem like Frequency Counter, Multiple Pointers, Sliding Window and Divide and Conquer. How to make an algorithm more efficient using some common patterns.


**5. Recursion**

Write recursive function. Find factorial fibonacci using recursion. How recursive function calls itself step by step.


**6. Searching Algorithms**

How linear and binar search works and their eifficiency and how to implement them step by step.


**7. Bubble Sort**

How to implement bubble sort and its time complexity


**8. Selection Sort**

How to implement selection sort and its time complexity

How to implement insertion sort and its time complexity


**10. Merge Sort**

How to implement merge sort and its time complexity and space complexity


**11. Quick Sort**

How to implement quick sort and its time complexity and space complexity


**12. Radix Sort**

How to implement radix sort and its time complexity and space complexity


**13. Singly Linked List**

Everything about singly linked list, how to push, pop, shift, unshift, insert, remove, and inverse a linked list.


**14. Doubly Linked List**

Everything about doubly linked list, how to push, pop, shift, unshift, insert, and remove.


**15. Stacks and Queues**

Everything about stacks and queues, how to implement stacks with linked list and push and pop, how to implement queues with linked list and enqueue and dequeue.


**16. Binary Search Trees**

Everything about trees, binary trees, specially binary search trees. How to insert and find a node in a binary search tree.
