# Data Structures and Algorithm

This repo is my notes of data struture and algorithm with javascript.

## 1. Big O notation

How to find out efficiency of an algorithm with Big-O Notation. How to find time and space complexity of an algorithm.

## 2. Built-in Data structures (e.g Objects and Arrays)

A deep dive into the built-in data structures and their methods like array.push pop slice map filter reduce and Object.keys entries values.

## 3. Problem Solving Approach

How to break down a problem step by step.

## 4. Problem Solving Patterns

Some common patterns of solving problem like Frequency Counter, Multiple Pointers, Sliding Window and Divide and Conquer. How to make an algorithm more efficient using some common patterns.
